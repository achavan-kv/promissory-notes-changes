It is also possible to type in a part that might not exist in the drop down. </p>
        <p class="MyStyle">&#160;</p>
        <p class="MyStyle">When the country parameter ‘SERVICE Labour Rate’ is enabled the labour cost will appear as a single field to be entered by the user.

        <p class="MyStyle">&#160;</p>
        <p class="MyStyle">The call will be closed with today’s date and a resolution description of ‘BER’. The user may have entered a labour cost, in which case the ‘Primary Charge To’ field will depend on the type of warranty, either FYW or extended.</p>

        <p class="MyStyle">The ‘Collected Goods on Loan’ tick box will only be enabled if the ‘Goods on Loan’ box was ticked on the ‘Product’ tab. If this box is enabled then it must be validated as a mandatory field when a resolution date is entered.
The ‘Food Loss’ group box will only be enabled when the extended warranty box is ticked or under FYW on the ‘Product’ tab. When ‘Food Loss’ is ticked the plus button next to this tick box will be enabled. This button will open the ‘Food Loss’ screen to allow food items to be added to a list. The ‘Food Loss’ tick box should remain ticked and be disabled when there are food items saved against the SR.

        <p class="MyStyle">There will be an ‘Additional Cost’ field for any other costs. The field ‘Total Cost’ will be read only and will total the cost of the labour, parts and any additional costs.
When the resolution date is entered then all of the fields in this list become mandatory:
