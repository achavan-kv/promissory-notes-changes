        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;" value="1">Commission will be calculated on all goods delivered based on date notified . The date from and date to period will be based on transactions posted since the last end of day SPIFF calculation run. </li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;" value="2">The Commission should be based on the cash/regular price (excluding tax). For countries where the country.taxtype = ‘I’  the commission should be reduced by the tax amount. 
</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;" value="3">Commission Order Calculation :When calculating commission extra SPIFFS from the new sales order screen will override normal SPIFFS.

            <li style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;" value="4">Discounts attached to products will (if they are a credit) reduce the value of the commission on the product and be excluded from any further commission calculation themselves. Discounts not attached will reduce the value of the commission based on their product/product group commission percentage. 
</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;" value="5">If an item is part of a kit product then the commission will be based on the commission percentage applied to the kit product not the item. </li>
