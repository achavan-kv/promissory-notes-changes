<h1>Transfer Transactions</h1>

<p>This allows transfer of money from one account to another. The options 
 to transfer are:</p>

<p>• one customer account to another customer account (Code XFR)</p>

<p>• a customer account to the sundry credit account – typically when the 
 customer has made a deposit payment (e.g. “dollar down”) – (Code SCX)</p>

<p>• the sundry credit account to the customer account (SCX) – the reversal 
 of the above</p>

<p>• Transferring from the sundry credit account to journal (Code JLX)</p>

<p>If choosing the sundry credit account it will choose the sundry credit 
 account belonging to the branch that you are currently in.</p>

<p>If transferring from the sundry credit account to journal the system 
 will prompt you with a date. This is so that it can calculate the amount 
 outstanding up to that date. For instance if you assume after 3 months 
 the customer is unlikely to come back for a refund then you could choose 
 to transfer to journal all transactions from more than 3 months ago. The 
 system will sum up the sundry transactions prior to this date and then 
 take into account any journal transactions made on this account. This 
 will give you the correct amount you can transfer to journal. Setting 
 the date to today’s date will transfer all sundry credits to the journal 
 account.</p>
