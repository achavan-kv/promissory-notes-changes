The return codes are necessary to work out the rebate that can be claimed back from AIG for the unexpired portion of the warranty. The customer will also receive a credit to their account for the unexpired portion of the warranty. This will be in the form of transactions CRE or CRF.&#160;</li>

            <li class="BodyText_3" value="8">A warranty is always repossessed with a zero value. This is because the customer is still expected to pay for the warranty. However we cannot expect the customer to pay the unexpired of the warranty. The customer is credited for the unexpired portion of the warranty based on the Warranty Return Codes set up in CoSACS. Any changes to return codes and % associated with them needs to be requested through <a href="mailto:cosacssupportcalls@strategicthought.com?subject=Support Question from the Online Help" title="Click here to email CoSACS Support" alt="Click here to email CoSACS Support">CoSACS Support</a>.</li>

        </p>
        <p class="BodyText_2" style="text-decoration: none;color: #ff0000;">Please note that warranties are not redelivered if a repossession is redelivered. This is because the redelivered item is considered as second hand by the Insurers and the item cover is terminated. </p>
