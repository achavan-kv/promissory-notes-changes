            <li value="1">An exchange occurs when the customer returns an item usually for repair and receives an exchange. The new product will not be the same as the one returned. </li>
            <li value="2">This section explains what happens to the warranty when a product with a warranty needs to be exchanged.</li>
            <li value="3">CoSACS performs a check based on the <a href="../Country Parameters/WarrantyCM.htm#1.1.20">“Warranty Validity Period”</a> parameter. This is defaulted to 12 months. </li>

            <li value="5">The new product put on the account will be linked to the original warranty automatically. Until the new product is added the warranty will not be linked to any item.</li>
            <li value="6">The user will not have the option to choose a warranty or decline a warranty on that product. The original warranty will be attached to the new item automatically.</li>

If the customer would like a new warranty then a warranty can be sold when the new product is added to the account. This will be via the usual warranty prompt. </span>

            <li value="8">The original warranty remains on the account but is not linked to any stock items. </li>
            <li value="9">For a replacement or exchange the warranty is not actually being returned. Its been used and remains on the account. FACT does not need a return record. When identical replacement is chosen in the goods return screen the Warranty Item will disappear. This is to prevent the user from trying to return a warranty while processing a replacement or exchange.  &#160;</li>
