        <h2 class="CH2">Insurance Claims on warranties</h2>
        <p>This will report on all Insurance claims which used the code INW. In the general financial transactions screen, when a user processes an INW on an account they will be prompted to choose the warrantable product being claimed against (if there is one). Courts are due a refund in these circumstances. The other reports won’t pick this up as it is not recognised as a Cancellation or a Repossession </p>
        <h2 class="CH2">Lost Warranty Sales Commission</h2>
        <p>This is a report on all the Missed Warranty Sale opportunities and how these misses affect the commission of the sales person.
</p>
        <p>A country parameter will be required for this report. It is called Target Hit rate %.</p>
        <p>Currently there is a target hit rate % assigned to warranty sales. For example:
</p>
        <p>Total Warrantable Sales Value= 1000
</p>
        <p>Target hit Rate % = 40%
</p>
        <p>Therefore required sales value for the sales person need to be 400 or above (1000 * 40%)
</p>
        <p>The	Lost Sales Value is calculated as: </p>
        <p>(Total Warranty Sales Value – Required Sales value. Only negative results should show here. If the value is positive it means that there was no lost sales value and the report should show a zero value)</p>
        <p>Lost units is calculated as:</p>
        <p>(Actual Warranties Sold Qty - (Total Warrantable Sales Qty * Target Hit rate %)). Only negative results should show here. If the value is positive it means that there was no lost sales units and the report should show a zero value</p>
        <p>Lost Commission is calculated as:</p>
        <p>(Lost Sales value * Commission rate against that warranty)</p>
