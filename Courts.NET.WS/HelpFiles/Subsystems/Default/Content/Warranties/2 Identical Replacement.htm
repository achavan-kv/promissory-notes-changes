        <p class="p_15">Identical Replacements are&#160;not very common but can occur when the delivered item is damaged and the item needs to be replaced with another identical item.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">When a replacement is processed in the <a href="../Deliveries/14.1Goods Return.htm#14.1">Goods return</a> screen, the delivery note for the new item is automatically generated at the same time the collection note is generated. This is because logistically the warehouse may want to deliver the new item and then pick up the old item in one load rather than doing the collection and the processing the new delivery. </li>
            <li value="2">When the identical replacement option is chosen in the goods return screen CoSACS will check if the warranty attached to that product is either within its <a href="../Country Parameters/WarrantyCM.htm#1.1.20">warranty validity period</a> or not. </li>
            <li value="3"><span class="span_20">If the warranty is </span><span class="span_21">still within the <a href="../Country Parameters/WarrantyCM.htm#1.1.20">validity period</a></span><span class="span_20"> then this warranty is automatically attached to the replacement item. </span>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><span class="span_22">This warranty will not be collected</span><span class="span_20"> when the original item is returned in the goods return screen. An exchange and identical replacement is different to a repossession or a cancellation because the warrant is being used as it was intended.</span>
            </li>
            <li value="5"><span class="span_20">If the warranty is not within the </span><span class="span_21"><a href="../Country Parameters/WarrantyCM.htm#1.1.20"><span class="span_21">warranty</span><span class="span_20"></span><span class="span_21"> validity period</span></a></span><span class="span_21"> <![CDATA[ ]]></span><span class="span_20">then the warranty will not be reattached to the replacement item as it is deemed to be fulfilled and the item no longer under warranty cover. If the customer would like a new warranty then a warranty can be </span><span class="span_20">sold to the customer.</span><span class="span_23"></span>The original warranty remains on the account but is not linked to any stock items</li>
            <li value="6">For a replacement or exchange the warranty is&#160;not actually being returned. It&#160;is been used and remains on the account. When identical replacement is chosen in the goods return screen the Warranty Item will disappear. This is to prevent the user from trying to return a warranty while processing a replacement or exchange. </li>
