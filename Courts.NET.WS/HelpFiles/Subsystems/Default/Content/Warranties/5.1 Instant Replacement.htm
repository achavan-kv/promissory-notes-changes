        <p class="p_17">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_18">The first step in the Instant Replacement return process is to assess the product while the customer is still in store. This is a quick assessment such as turning it on or quickly inspecting it to see if there is an obvious problem. If the item is working fine then the Customer will take the product home and we will not replace it.</p>

            <li value="3">If the item is being replaced within Period 1 &amp; 2 from date of original sale then the warranty return pop up is disabled because the original warranty stays in place.</li>
