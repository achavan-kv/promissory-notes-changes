<h1>Payment Screen</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Payments screen is used to take payments 
 across the different account types (Cash, Hire Purchase, Ready Finance) 
 belonging to a Customer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 12pt;
			x-text-underline: off;
			font-weight: bold;
			/*begin!kadov{{*/ text-decoration: none; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">Payments 
 on combined Ready Finance accounts</p>

<p style="x-text-underline: normal; /*begin!kadov{{*/ text-decoration: underline; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If there is more 
 than 1 Ready Finance account that has been delivered, these will appear 
 as combined and any payment made will be split across all Ready Finance 
 accounts (It will be a pro rata split).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">Towards the right-hand 
 side of the screen there is a button called ‘Combined Ready Finance Accounts’. 
 Clicking on this button will enable you to view the individual details 
 (such as Instalment, Outstanding Balance, Arrears, Payment) on each account.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Details tab towards 
 the right-hand side of the screen should display the combined details 
 for the combined Ready Finance accounts (e.g. Outstanding Balance, Instalment 
 Amount, Arrears).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a payment amount 
 is entered on the Payments screen which is &lt; than the combined installment 
 amount across the Ready Finance accounts, the payment should be correctly 
 split in proportion to the installment amounts on each account, where 
 an adjustment may be made to the most recently opened Ready Finance account 
 to ensure that the correct payment is made. This can be seen by clicking 
 on the 'Combined Ready Finance' button. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a payment amount 
 is entered <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->on 
 the Payments screen which is = to the combined installment amount, the 
 payment should be correctly split where the installment amount on each 
 account is exactly paid. This can be seen by clicking on the 'Combined 
 Ready Finance' button. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">Through the ‘Ready 
 Finance Combined’ screen for individual Ready Finance accounts, you are 
 able to override a payment amount on any of the accounts by entering a 
 value into the Payment field.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the combined ‘Settlement 
 Figure’ is entered into the Payment Amount field, then the individual 
 settlement amounts should be paid on each account. This can be seen by 
 viewing the split by clicking on the 'Combined Ready Finance' button. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a Payment Amount 
 is entered which covers the ‘Settlement Amount’ of some Ready Finance 
 accounts, then the split will make sure that only the settlement amount 
 is paid towards these accounts. </p></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;
			font-weight: bold;
			x-text-underline: off;

 on combined Ready Finance accounts allocated to Bailiffs</p>

<p style="x-text-underline: normal; text-align: justify; /*begin!kadov{{*/ text-decoration: underline; /*}}end!kadov*/ ">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If an account is 
 in arrears, is allocated to a bailiff and the debit account indicator 
 is set to true for the bailiff (on Bailiff Commissions) screen then two 
 new fields should appear in the Payments screen which are ‘Total Amount’ 
 &amp; ‘Credit Fee’.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">Entering ‘0’ in the 
 ‘Total Amount’ field should correctly calculate the whole payment amount 
 that you would be needed to cover the arrears + fee amount on the accounts.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If there are multiple 
 Ready Finance accounts allocated to different bailiffs, than you should 
 note that the Fee on each individual account should be based on the commission 
 rate of the Bailiff allocated to that account.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that 
 the Fee is calculated based on the status that the account was in when 
 it was allocated to the Bailiff, and the commission percentage that applies 
 to that status. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that 
 there is a country parameter ‘Fees calculated on Payment Amount’ (under 
 Tax/Service Charges/Fees). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 this is set to True, then the minimum Part Payment is the part payment 
 + fee amount needed to cover the minimum part payment. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If ‘Fees calculated 
 on Payment Amount’ is set to False, then the minimum Part Payment is just 
 the arrears amount.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">If <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->there 
 are multiple Ready Finance accounts allocated to different bailiffs and 
 you enter a payment amount for one of the accounts in the ‘Combined Ready 
 Finance’ screen, then the FEE field should be auto-calculated. Again the 
 Fee amount calculated will depend upon different criteria such as the 
 amount you have entered, the status of the account, and whether you are 
 making a whole or part payment. The payment should only be processed against 
 the account that you entered the payment amount for and all other Ready 
 Finance accounts should remain the same as before the transaction.</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">When a Payment Amount 
 is entered which is split across Ready Finance accounts, or an individual 
 account (through the 'Combined Ready Finance Accounts' screen and a receipt 
 is printed, the combined remaining balance across all Ready Finance accounts 
 should be printed on the receipt. This also applies when the transactions 
 are updated on the Payments Card. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">When a new Payment 
 Card is printed, the combined Agreement Total of the Ready Finance accounts 
 should be displayed. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="text-align: justify;">Individual statements 
 on each Ready Finance account can be printed by selecting the account 
 from the Accounts List (black arrow marks the highlighted account), and 
 then selecting from the menu ‘Print' -&gt; Statement of Account’. The 
 details of that account should only be printed.</p></li>
