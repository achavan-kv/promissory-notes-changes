5. Support for devices in future releases
   The following list describes items restricted in this release and how to deal
   with problems. Also, please be sure to refer to the Application Development
   Guide notes. This list mainly takes up items not specified in the Application
   Development Guide. However, the fact that an item is not included here does
   not mean there are no restrictions on that item.

[USB interface devices]
 * Supported OS
   The USB interface devices are supported by Windows 98 Second Edition/
   Windows2000 / WindowsXP USB interface devices cannot be installed on 
   Windows 98 Second Edition, WindowsXP or Windows2000. (See note)

 * port setting
   See the user's manual for details.

 * Line Display
   When connecting a Line display to the UIB-BOARD (UB-U01/02) the
   following connection sequence is necessary.
   1. Connect the UIB-BOARD to the TM-Printer Master device.
   2. Connect the Line display to the DM-D port on the UIB-BOARD.
   3. Turn on the Line display power.
   4. Turn on the Printer power.
   If this sequence is not followed the Line display will not be properly 
   detected.

 * Note
    Install the USB driver from the hard disk.
    (Driver is automatically copied in the folder in which OPOS has 
    installed.(Default:\ProgramFiles\OPOS\EPSON2))
    See the user's manual for details.

[Notes on using the 9-pin serial interface board (called the UB-S09 hereafter)]
 * The UB-S09 has a DM-D connector and is installed in an EPSON TM printer.
   The UB-S09 enables a connection with a DM display even if the TM printer
   is not equipped with a DM-D connector via a Y-connection.
   With the TM printer and a DM-D display connected, the UB-S09 can communicate 
   with the serial interface of the host computer at a maximum speed of 
   115.2 K bps (bps: bits per second).

   1. Set the jumper on the UB-S09 or the DIP switch on the TM printer to 
      the appropriate positions if necessary when the DM-D display is
      connected to the DM-D connector of the UB-S09 or to the TM printer.
      A DM-D display cannot be connected to both the 
      UB-S09 and a TM printer simultaneously.  Connect the DM-D display to 
      either one of the DM-D connectors.  
      Refer to the user's manual of the UB-S09 or the TM printer 
      for the correct jumper or DIP switch settings.
   2. The serial communication condition of the UB-S09 depends on the DIP 
      switch of the TM printer itself.  Refer to the user's manual of the
      TM printer to be used for the correct DIP switch settings.
   3. When a DM-D display is connected to the UB-S09, the power is supplied
      to the DM-D display from the TM printer regardless of whether the power 
      switch of the TM printer is on or off (except for the TM-J8000).  
      Note that the DM-D display always receives its power from the TM printer.
   4. When the UB-S09 is connected to the RP-U420, the DM-D display cannot be
      used through the DM-D connector of the UB-S09 since the power is not 
      supplied from the RP-U420 to the DM-D display. 
      However, the RP-U420 works normally except for this.

[The Network Interface Device (hereafter, UB-E01)]
   The UB-E01 can be installed in the TM printer which is compatible with the 
   interface board system. If the UB-E01 is installed, the Line display (DM-D) 
   connector with which the TM printer is equipped can not be used.
   The UB-E01 enables communications by 10BASE-T and is compatible with the 
   TCP/IP protocol. If it is to be used (each setting), ask the network 
   administrator who is in charge.
   During Open, or Claim, the TM printer's power Off / On operation is 
   supported, but after it is turned On, it cannot be guaranteed that it will 
   reconnect, so exercise caution. During Open or Claim, that PC has a 
   monopoly on its connection with the TM printer. (Another PC cannot connect 
   with it.) However, if the TM printer's power is turned OFF once, then 
   turned On again, any PC existing on the network can connect with that 
   TM printer. At that time, the OPOS of a PC which is in the middle of a 
   Claim will attempt to reconnect automatically, but if another PC's OPOS 
   also attempts to make a Claim, it is not clear which will be able to make 
   the connection. The PC which is the earliest to request connection can 
   establish the connection. Accordingly, a TM printer which has had its power 
   turned Off and On after Open or Claim, may not necessarily be available to 
   reconnect to, so exercise caution.When the TM printer's power is turned On, 
   and when it is reset, it takes approximately 20 seconds until the network 
   function is operated, so exercise caution.
 
[Installation]
  * If upgrading ( or downgrade ) the EPSON OPOS ADK, 
    and have already performed in EPSON OPOS ADK uninstallation,
    please reboot system first.
  * If devices are specified in a custom install, and a .REG file
    containing unspecified device information is used to initialize the
    registry, the SetupPOS utility may show a warning about the port
    setting. Choose OK and reset the port, or press Cancel to ignore the
    warning.
  * When using the REG file, make sure the environment of the computer used to 
    make the REG file and the environment of the computer reflecting the REG 
    file are the same.
  * If the installation fails for some reason and you cancel in the middle
    of it, be sure to do it again. If this happens, there is a possibility
    that files and environment can't be cleaned even if you execute
    uninstall.
  * When ServicePack4 is installed, the following message is indicated. 
    This is because CheckScanner is not included in the base version.
    Proceed with the installation as is when you want to use CheckScanner.

     The following devices and files cannot be installed after the 
     installation of service pack 4.
       CheckScanner : SO
     It is recommended to have them installed before installing service pack4
     in case they are needed in the future. Proceed with installation ?
	
[SetupPOS]
  * The hydra connection depends on the capability of the each device connection 
    when a device using COM, LPT, USB, or Ethernet interface is adding to a port 
    on which other device is already set.
    If the device cannot use selected port, a message is displayed. 
    Then, select other available port. 
    For example, when a LineDisplay2 (POSPrinter2) is adding to COM1 
    on which a POSPrinter1 and a LineDisplay1 are already hydra-connected, 
    an error massage may be displayed. 
    In the case, set a port as follows.
    When adding a LineDisplay2 (POSPrinter2), an error message is displayed.
    The message is displayed on communication setting dialog. 
    In the dialog, set a port(For example, set to COM2). If an illegal 
    hydra connection is set, an error will be displayed in the contradictory 
    warning of a setup registry dialog. In the case, select OK button. 
    Then the contradictory is automatically corrected.
  * When hydra connection is set using the host name under the Network Device, 
    please make sure to name the same host name (including capital/small 
    characters differences) between a master device and the slave device.
    In case the same host name (including capital/small characters differences) 
    is not named for a master device and the slave device, the operation is not
    guaranteed.
  * Do the registration again after installing Service Pack 4 when registering 
    TM-H6000II printer and MICR.
    If not, the CheckScanner of TM-H6000II cannot be registered normally.

[Cash Drawer]
  * The CashDrawer supported by EPSON OPOS is controlled through the
    POSPrinter. Therefore the OpenDrawer method can be influenced by
    POSPrinter action. For example, if the OpenDrawer method is 
    executed while data is printing on POSPrinter, the OpenDrawer method
    return a timeout error. But after  a little later, the StatusUpdateEvent
    may fire, resulting in an Open CashDrawer. To avoid this case, 
    it is recommended that the OpenDrawer method be executed before printing
    data  on POSPrinter.
  * The drawer sets the DrawerOpened property, and fires the
    StatusUpdateEvent when DeviceEnabled property becomes true. However,
    when the POSPrinter that connected with the CashDrawer is in an error
    state, the CashDrawer cannot detect state changes until a CashDrawer
    method is called. Please confirm printer's state before setting
    DeviceOpened property to true.

[Hard Totals]
    Hard Totals using EPSON series NVRAM needs a driver to access the NVRAM: 
    EPSON NVRAM Driver. In an environment where the EPSON NVRAM Driver is not
    installed, Hard Totals cannot be installed. To install Hard Totals onto a
    machine on which you are going to use the EPSON NVRAM Driver, install the
    driver first. For how to purchase the EPSON NVRAM Driver, check with the 
    company where you bought the IM hardware.

[CheckScanner]
    CheckScanner's specification is specific to EPSON.
    Therefore there is no CCO. 
    EPSON CO CheckScanner will be installed from ServicePack4 even when CCO 
    is installed in the base version.

[EPSON IM series(Windows2000 and WindowsXP Support)]
  * EPSON IM-310/600
    Windows2000 and WindowsXP is supported.

  * EPSON IM-505/515/300
    Operation under Windows2000 or WindowsXP is not supported.
    There are no plans to support this configuration.

[POSPrinter]
  In the TM-L60II, with using the TransactionPrint method,
  Service Object retains the output data of MarkFeed method.
  If MarkFeed method's parameter is PTR_MF_TO_TAKEUP, errors will be occurred
  when the TransactionPrint method's buffering mode is released.
  Due to the specfication, printer will become offline after executing MarkFeed
  method until the Feed button is pushed.
	  
6. Other Considerations

  (1) When you create multiple forms and set them up to access a single ADK
      object in a Visual Basic project, the following problems occur when
      properties are accessed or methods are called:
	  * The method or property accessed first does not return until all
	     processing has been completed. (The project hangs.)
	  * The Close() method causes a Visual Basic error when called.
      Please make sure that all methods and properties accessed by one from
      are completely finished before any other form accesses a method or
      property.
 
  (2) Coexisting with Version 1.xx(After Version1.60)
     *The devices of Version1.xx(after Version1.60) and the devices of Version 2.xx 
      can operate simultaneously.(Refer to the User's guide.) 
      However, when executing installations of the both versions, 
      be sure to first install the Version 1.xx.  
      When executing the uninstaller, first uninstall Version 2.xx, 
      or use the uninstaller of Version 2.xx to uninstall Version 1.xx. 
      If the uninstaller of Version 1.xx is used without considering the order, 
      the operation is not guaranteed.  
      In such cases, be sure to perform a reinstallation.

     *When coexisting Version 1.xx and the Version 2.xx, the following devices
      on the same port or the same keyboard interface board cannot coexist 
      and be shared between versions.
        Hydra Setting devices: POSPriter, CashDrawer, Display
        Keyboard Interface devices: MSR,Keylock 
      When those settings are detected while installing, 
      Version1.xx settings are deleted forcibly.
      When setting by the SetupPOS utility, the warning will not be displayed.
      However the operation is not guaranteed.

     *The following cases can not be inherited to properly from ver1.xx. 
       When Printer's paper width is changed.
       Keylock setting.
 
  (3) The DoEvents Process in Visual Basic
      If you want to get an Event in the midst of a procedure, use DoEvents.
      For example,for a cash drawer, which you programmed to execute
      WaitforDrawerClose immediately after executing the OpenDrawer method,
      an Event never occurs until control returns to the application.
      Putting a DoEvents instruction between the OpenDrawer method and 
      WaitforDrawerClose method executes StatusUpdateEvent and enables you to
      get an Event.

  (4) This version supports LPT1 through LPT3. However LPT3 has not been fully
